# fnx

A package manager for the [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/) language.

> _**Disclaimer:** It's an early-stage project, and you should expect breaking changes._

## 1-liner Installer

You need to have all [requirements](#requirements) first.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbaptista/fnx/main/get-fnx.sh -o get-fnx.sh && sh get-fnx.sh
```

## `.fnx.fnl` File

The `.fnx.fnl` file is a regular Fennel source code in the root directory of your project that should return a table.

Example:

```fennel
{:name    "my-package"
 :version "0.0.1"

 :dependencies {
   :fspec         {:fennel/local "../fspec"}

   :supernova     {:lua/local "../supernova"}

   :splah         {:fennel/fnx {:path "/home/splah"}}

   :radioactive   {:fennel/fnx {:git/url "https://git.sr.ht/~me/radioactive"}}
   :fireball      {:fennel/fnx {:git/url "https://github.com/me/fireball.git"}}

   :moonlight     {:fennel/fnx {:git/sourcehut "~me/moonlight" :commit "a6c728b"}}

   :meteor        {:fennel/fnx {:git/sourcehut "~me/meteor" :branch "main"}}

   :jellyfish     {:fennel/fnx {:git/sourcehut "~me/jellyfish" :tag "v0.0.1"}}

   :purple-rain   {:fennel/fnx {:git/github "me/purple-rain"}}

   :dkjson        {:lua/rock ">= 2.5"}}}
```

| key | description |
|-----|-------------|
| `:name` | Your package name. |
| `:version` | Your package version. Follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) |
| `:dependencies` | Your package dependencies. The example above should be self explanatory. |

## Usage

> _Try the [Hello World](https://github.com/gbaptista/fnx-hello-world) example._

Start by creating a [.fnx.fnl](#fnxfnl-file) file for your project.

| command &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | description |
|---------|-------------|
| `fnx` | Itâ€™s an alias for the `fennel` command that wraps it with `fnx` capabilities. Just use it as a replacement for anything that you would do with `fennel`. It accept any of the options available for the `fennel` command. |
| `fnx help` | List the available `fnx` commands. |
| `fnx version` | It returns the `fnx` version. |
| `fnx config` | It returns the current `fnx` configuration. |
| `fnx debug` | It returns `fnx` injections for the current directory. |
| `fnx env` | Generates environment variables exports to make `fnx` embeddable. |
| `fnx dep` | Dependencies Manager CLI. It lists the available `fnx dep` commands. Its commands accept `--global` and `--local` for `luarocks`. The default is `--local`. |
| `fnx dep install` | Install the dependencies described in the `.fnx.fnl` file. Use `-f` to force the re-installation of all dependencies. Use `--verbose` for verbose mode. |
| `fnx dep uninstall` | Uninstall the dependencies described in the `.fnx.fnl` file. Use `-f` to skip confirmation. Use `--verbose` for verbose mode. |
| `fnx dep list` | It lists the dependencies described in the `.fnx.fnl` file. |

## Embedding

As is usual for Lua, you may want to embed Fennel into another language, e.g., [_Sweet Moon_](https://github.com/gbaptista/sweet-moon). In this scenario, you wouldn't have direct access to the `fnx` terminal command.

So, you can run `fnx env` to generate the necessary environment variables:
```shell
fnx env

export FENNEL_PATH=/home/me/.local/share/.fnx/core/?.fnl
export FNX_DATA_DIRECTORY=/home/me/.local/share/.fnx/
```

To actual export the variables, you can use:
```sh
eval "$(fnx env)"
```

You can also add the above line to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.

Then, in your embedded script, you can add:
```fennel
(local fnx (require :fnx))

(fnx.bootstrap!)
```

It automatically injects all your dependencies according to your `.fnx.fnl` file, similar to using the `fnx` command.

You may want to set a specific path to the `.fnx.fnl`:

```fennel
(local fnx (require :fnx))

(fnx.bootstrap! "/home/me/project/.fnx.fnl")
```

Alternative code, for isolation:
```fennel
(let [fnx (require :fnx)] (fnx.bootstrap!))
```

Or, for short:
```fennel
((. (require :fnx) :bootstrap!))
```

## Installing

You need to have all [requirements](#requirements) first.

Check the [1-liner Installer](#1-liner-installer) as well.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:gbaptista/fnx.git

cd fnx

luarocks install supernova --local

fennel run/install.fnl
```

### Installation Options

Options for the `fennel run/install.fnl` command:

| option | description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-s` | Use auto-detect information and skip questions. |
| `-f` | Use auto-detect information and overwrite files without confirmation. |
| `-d` | Install in development mode as a [symbolic link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) for the source code. |

### Requirements

- [Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html)
- [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/setup#downloading-fennel)
- [LuaRocks](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)
  - [`sh`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) [`chmod`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod) `cp` `ln` `ls` `mkdir` `rm`

### Performance

You might not be happy with the performance of the `fnx` command compared to  `fennel`.

Alternatively, to continue keep using the `fennel` command, you can do the same configuration used for [embedding](#embedding):

Export the enviroment variables:
```sh
eval "$(fnx env)"
```

Add into your entrypoint source code:

```fennel
(let [fnx (require :fnx)] (fnx.bootstrap!))
```

Done. Just run `fennel entrypoint.fnl` as usual instead of `fnx entrypoint.fnl`.

### Not a Roadmap

A list of things that I don't have time to do or that just aren't itching me enough to do something about it, but I would like to do it someday, eventually:

- [ ] binaries;
- [ ] `fnx dep add`;
- [ ] `fnx dep remove`;
- [ ] Lock file;
- [ ] Actually use the version numbers for something;
- [ ] Improve performance;
- [ ] Get inspired by [nix](https://nixos.org) to improve the approach;
- [ ] Provide Windows Support.
